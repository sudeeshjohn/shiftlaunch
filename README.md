# ShiftLaunch - OpenShift Deployer for IBM Power Systems

A comprehensive Go-based tool for deploying OpenShift clusters (SNO or
Multi-Node) on IBM Power Systems using the User-Provisioned Infrastructure
(UPI) method with **full automation**—from starter configuration generation to
cluster ready state.

## Overview

ShiftLaunch provides **end-to-end automation** for OpenShift deployment on IBM
Power Systems with support for two distinct boot methods:

### 🎯 Boot Methods

#### 1. Agent-based Installer (Recommended for Production)

- ✅ **Simplified Deployment**: Single ISO contains all installation artifacts.
- ✅ **No DHCP/PXE Required**: Eliminates network boot complexity (uses static
  IPs via NMState).
- ✅ **NFS-Based**: ISO served via NFS from the controller directly to the VIOS.
- ✅ **Unified Installation**: Bootstrap and installation combined into a
  single phase.
- ✅ **Better for Disconnected**: All artifacts can be embedded in the ISO.
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: ISO mappings and NFS exports are removed after
  installation.

#### 2. User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI / PXE Boot)

- ✅ **Standard PXE Workflow**: Traditional UPI boot method.
- ✅ **HMC REST API**: Automated netboot using IBM's Hardware Management
  Console.
- ✅ **DHCP/TFTP/HTTP**: Full network boot stack managed locally.
- ✅ **MAC-Based Config**: Automated, per-node GRUB configurations.
- ✅ **Flexible**: Supports custom kernel boot parameters.

### 🚀 Core Features

- ✅ **Bring Your Own Infrastructure (BYOI)**: Bring your own enterprise Load Balancers, DNS, DHCP, PXE, or NFS—or let ShiftLaunch manage them locally.
- ✅ **Smart Configuration Generator**: Interactive, dynamic template
  generation that adapts to your chosen topology and boot method.
- ✅ **Installation Monitoring**: Automated monitoring with
  `openshift-install wait-for` commands.
- ✅ **Single VIP Architecture**: One IP per cluster via port-based routing
  (50% IP savings).
- ✅ **Resume Functionality**: Safely resume failed deployments from the last
  completed phase.
- ✅ **State Management**: Tracks deployment progress with isolated JSON state
  files.
- ✅ **Enhanced Status Display**: Instantly view cluster nodes, IPs,
  endpoints, and credentials without SSH.

## Architecture

### Single VIP Architecture

- **One IP per Cluster**: Replaces the traditional dual VIP (API + Ingress) approach.
- **Port-Based Routing**: HAProxy routes traffic via Layer 4 TCP based
  strictly on ports (6443 for API, 22623 for Machine Config, 80/443 for
  Ingress).
- **Simplified DNS**: All DNS records (api, api-int, *.apps) point to a single
  VIP.

### Multi-Cluster Support

- **IP Aliasing**: Each cluster gets a dedicated VIP aliased to the
  controller's physical interface.
- **Workspace Isolation**: Separate directories, configs, and service
  instances located at `/opt/shiftlaunch/clusters/<cluster-name>/`.
- **HTTP Directory Structure**: Isolated `/var/www/html/<cluster-name>/` paths
  for hosting ignition and RHCOS payloads.

## Bring Your Own Infrastructure (BYOI)

ShiftLaunch supports flexible infrastructure management through the `managed_services` configuration block. If you already have enterprise infrastructure in place, you can bring your own Load Balancer (LB), DNS, DHCP, PXE, or NFS servers. You can choose to:

1. **Fully Managed** - ShiftLaunch installs and manages all services locally on the controller (DNS, DHCP, PXE, HAProxy, NFS).
2. **Partially Managed** - Mix and match locally managed services with your external enterprise services.
3. **BYOI Mode** - Disable all local services. Use your external F5 Load Balancers, InfoBlox DNS, and enterprise DHCP. ShiftLaunch will act purely as an orchestrator for HMC LPAR provisioning, Ignition generation, and installation monitoring.

#### Example: Fully Managed (ISO Boot)

```yaml
managed_services:
  dns: true
  dhcp: false          # Not required for NMState-driven ISO boot
  pxe: false           # Not required for ISO boot
  load_balancer: true
  nfs: true            # Required to host Agent ISOs to the VIOS
```

#### Example: BYOI Mode (Netboot)

```yaml
managed_services:
  dns: false           # Using enterprise InfoBlox
  dhcp: false          # Using enterprise DHCP
  pxe: false           # Using enterprise PXE server
  load_balancer: false # Using enterprise F5 Big-IP
  nfs: false
```

## Prerequisites

Before deploying OpenShift clusters with ShiftLaunch, ensure you have:

### Infrastructure Requirements

1. **Additional IP Address (VIP)**
   - One dedicated IP address per cluster for the Load Balancer VIP
   - This IP will be aliased to the controller's network interface
   - Must be in the same subnet as your cluster nodes

2. **IBM Power LPARs**

   The number of LPARs required depends on your deployment type:

   | Deployment Type | Boot Method | Minimum LPARs Required | Configuration |
   | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
   | **Single Node OpenShift (SNO)** | ISO or Netboot | **1** | 1 Master (combined control plane + worker) |
   | **Multi-Node (Agent ISO)** | ISO | **5** | 3 Masters + 2 Workers |
   | **Multi-Node (Network Boot)** | Netboot | **6** | 1 Bootstrap + 3 Masters + 2 Workers |

   > **Note:** Network Boot requires an additional bootstrap node that is automatically removed after the cluster installation completes.

3. **Controller Node**
   - RHEL 9/10 or CentOS 9/10
   - Network connectivity to HMC and cluster nodes
   - Sufficient disk space for OpenShift artifacts (~10GB per cluster)

---

## Usage

> **⚠️ Important:** ShiftLaunch must be run from the controller node (bastion
> host) running **RHEL 9/10** or **CentOS 9/10**. The controller node
> orchestrates all deployment activities including HMC interactions, service
> management, and cluster provisioning.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Generate a smart configuration template
# For Single Node OpenShift (SNO) with Agent-based Installer (ISO):
./shiftlaunch generate-config -type sno -boot iso -config my-sno.yaml

# For Multi-Node cluster with User Provisioned Infrastructure (Netboot):
./shiftlaunch generate-config -type multi -boot netboot -config my-multi.yaml

# 2. Edit the generated configuration with your infrastructure details
vi my-sno.yaml  # or my-multi.yaml

# 3. Validate the configuration against the HMC and local controller
./shiftlaunch validate -config my-sno.yaml

# 4. Deploy the cluster
./shiftlaunch create -config my-sno.yaml

# 5. Check status (shows nodes, IPs, endpoints, and kubeadmin credentials)
./shiftlaunch status -cluster my-sno
```

### Command Reference

#### Generate Configuration Template

Create a highly-documented configuration template tailored exactly to your
topology and boot method. The generator is "smart"—it automatically omits the
`bootstrap` node and `rhcos_images` URLs if you select ISO boot, and toggles
the required managed services (like NFS vs PXE) accordingly.

```bash
# Generate SNO configuration with Agent ISO boot (recommended)
./shiftlaunch generate-config -type sno -boot iso -config sno-cluster.yaml

# Generate SNO configuration with traditional Network Boot
./shiftlaunch generate-config -type sno -boot netboot -config sno-netboot.yaml

# Generate Multi-Node configuration with Agent ISO boot
./shiftlaunch generate-config -type multi -boot iso -config prod-cluster.yaml

# Generate Multi-Node configuration with traditional Network Boot
./shiftlaunch generate-config -type multi -boot netboot -config prod-netboot.yaml
```

#### Validate Configuration

Validate your YAML configuration, verify local controller disk space, check for
VIP conflicts, and validate LPAR/Storage existence on the HMC:

```bash
./shiftlaunch validate -config my-cluster.yaml
```

#### Deploy Cluster

Deploy a new OpenShift cluster. If a previous deployment failed, running this
command again will automatically detect the `state.json` file and safely resume
from the last completed phase.

```bash
./shiftlaunch create -config my-cluster.yaml
```

#### Check Status

View real-time cluster status, node assignments, and connection credentials:

```bash
./shiftlaunch status -cluster my-cluster
```

**Status Output Includes:**

- Cluster deployment status and phase history.
- Cluster nodes with hostnames, roles, and IP addresses.
- Service endpoints (API, Console, OAuth, Prometheus, Grafana).
- A **Single-line `/etc/hosts` entry** for easy copy-pasting.
- Local path to your `kubeconfig` and `kubeadmin` password.

#### Delete Cluster

Safely tear down a deployed cluster.

ShiftLaunch uses **Intelligent Partial Failure Handling**. It tracks exactly
which resources (LPARs, Virtual Disks, Optical Media) fail to delete. If a
deletion fails (e.g., a disk is locked), it preserves the failure in the state
file. Re-running the delete command will safely retry *only* the failed
resources, ensuring zero orphaned infrastructure.

```bash
# Delete using cluster name
./shiftlaunch delete --cluster my-cluster

# Or delete using config file
./shiftlaunch delete --config my-cluster.yaml
```

#### Generate External Service Configurations

If you opt to use external, unmanaged services (BYOI mode), generate the exact DNS, DHCP, and Load Balancer rules you need to hand off to your network administrators. You can safely output this to a text file for easy sharing.

```bash
./shiftlaunch service-configs --config my-cluster.yaml > network-requirements.txt
```

   - REST API enabled.
   - User credentials with LPAR and VIOS management permissions.

3. **IBM Power Systems**:
   - Managed by the target HMC.
   - Sufficient Compute and Memory resources.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"File 'config.yaml' already exists. Refusing to overwrite"**
   - **Cause**: You are running `generate-config` but the target file already
     exists.
   - **Solution**: Delete the existing file or specify a different output path
     using `-config new-name.yaml`.

2. **"Cluster is already managed and fully deployed"**
   - **Cause**: You attempted to run `create` on a cluster directory that
     contains a `.managed` marker (indicating a healthy, finished cluster).
   - **Solution**: To redeploy, you must explicitly `delete` the cluster first
     to prevent accidental data loss.
